# [Project 1: Microsoft Malware Prediction](https://github.com/harikiran-mudipalli/Microsoft_Malware_Detection/blob/master/msmp.ipynb) 
*2019*

The goal of this project is to predict the probability of a Windows Machine getting infected with a malware. The training dataset had around 9 million examples and 80 features on which I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning, and applied classification algorithms for predictions.

* **Python Libraries used:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

# [project 2: Flu Shot Learning](https://github.com/harikiran-mudipalli/Flu_Shot_Learning/blob/master/EDA%20and%20Cleaning.ipynb)

# [Project 3: Dog breed Classifier](https://github.com/harikiran-mudipalli/ImageClassifierAIPND)
*2020*

I Should admit that I'm a dog lover and that motivated me to build this project to classify breed of a dog when a dog image is provided as an Input.
