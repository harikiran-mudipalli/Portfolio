The goal of this project is to predict the probability of a Windows Machine getting infected with a malware. The training dataset had around 9 million examples and 80 features on which I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning, and applied classification algorithms for predictions.

* **Python Libraries used:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
